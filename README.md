# üëã Hello!

## My name is `Dalin Stone` and I am currently a `Data Engineer` at `Saela`.
### I work with Customer, Employee, Payroll, Revenue, and Sales KPI-SLA metrics and data.

### üõ†Ô∏è Current `outside of work` project:
- Using Django, PostgreSQL, and HTML/CSS to create a web app that tracks Diablo 3 user item metrics and calculates better item sets for the user based on character level using the Blizzard API for Diablo 3

### üõ†Ô∏è Things I am *currently* working on `at work`:
- Creating Docker containers to run our Prefect ETL pipeline on an AWS EC2 instance
- Speeding up the ETL pipeline by adding list comprehension, NumPy calculations, and data type down casting where necessary
- Migrating the new ETL production data into Tableau Dashboards as Tableau Datasources (*when possible*)

### ‚úÖ Things I *accomplished* `at work`:
- Created Python scripts in Prefect using NumPy and Pandas to pull data from an internal web/mobile app MySQL database, transform the data, and then write the data to a data team facing MySQL data warehouse for downstream consumption by C-Suite, Manager, and Supervisor level users through Tableau Dashboards
- Developed a toolkit for my team, replacing MySQL database driver read-and-write functionality, resulting in 95% faster read/write ETL runtimes
- Used the Tableau Hyper API and pantab (*a package for Pandas dataframe interactivity with Tableau hyper files*) to create a tool for my team to create Tableau hyper files from Pandas dataframes and publish those files as datasources to Tableau Server
- Coded a Dask tool for performing multi-processing, concurrency, and lazy calculations on data where needed
- Migrated new ETL production data into Tableau Dashboards as Tableau Datasources
- Fielded and Remediated JIRA tickets for Tableau Server Administration support across the company

### ‚úÖ Things I *accomplished* in `previous roles`:
- *@Abnormal Security*: Created KPI and SLA metrics dashboards in DataBricks using SQL for my team of 30 analysts as an after hours project to support my team
- *@Abnormal Security*: Created a Google App using GCP to track my teams working hours. After not receiving approval to implement the app on my team (*for budget reasons*), I wrote a JavaScript script using the Google Sheets and Forms API to automate emailing a form to each analyst on the team. This required a lot of reminding and didn't erase the problem. Finally, I created a Slack Integration that would ping each person 15 minutes before their shift ended and send them the form to fill out. These numbers were used by the Data team to project hiring numbers. (*I asked my manager what I could take off her plate and she wanted a better way to track working hours. These are the ideas I brainstormed.*)
- *@Abnormal Security*: Led a project that allowed 3 groups of analysts (about 4 people each) to use their coding talents to create other dashboards in DataBricks for Weekend and Daily KPI-SLA metrics
- *@Abnormal Security*: Created a previously non-existent Quality Assurance program for a team of 30 analysts. This program revealed that if a cybersecurity analyst could slow down their remediation time, increase the time spent reading documentation, and ask questions whenever possible, the analyst could increase their accuracy of remediation by ~8%. This program was implemented on the team to increase low-performing analyst KPI/SLA metrics to an OKR target of 8% higher.
- *@Goldman Sachs*: Led the effort on my team to pull data using Oracle SQL (*Aqua Data Studio*) and SQL/T-SQL (DataBricks and Snowflake) to identify consumer financial crime and fraud in a targeted forensic investigation. 
- *@Goldman Sachs*: Assisted in identifying Crypto related financial crime and fraud through a targeted investigation of thousands of Crypto related transactions. 

### üìö What I'm studying at the moment:
- Golang
- scikit-learn
- RabbitMQ
- Kafka
- Spark

### Loosely scoped projects:
- Create a College Football data ingestion engine that uses a neural network to predict weekly 'AP TOP 25' rankings and final 4 contenders based on players level and team level stats
- Using the GMail API develop a email cybersecurity ML/AI remediation tool
